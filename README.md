To operate the app, the first thing is to run "npm install" to install necessary packages

Then, run "npm start" which should also start the server
    Some firewalls may need to be reconfigured to allow traffic on port 3001 

If there is a problem with the server, running "npx kill-port 3001" then running "node server.js" should correct any issues
